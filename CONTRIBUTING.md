## Reporting Issues

This is a great way to contribute. Before reporting an issue, please review
current open issues to see if there are any matches.

### How to Report an Issue

Issues should be reported to this project's Github Issues page: [https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-hyper-directory/issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-hyper-directory/issues)

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how
to reproduce it. If possible, provide instructions for how to reproduce the
issue within the vagrant development environment.

Details are key. Please include the following:

* OS version
* Hyper Directory version
* Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
* Steps to reproduce
* Actual results
* Expected results

## Contributing Code

Hyperledger Sawtooth Hyper Directory is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts

### Ways to Contribute

Contributions by the community help grow and optimize the capabilities of
Hyperledger Sawtooth, and are the most effective method of having a positive
impact on the project.

#### Different ways you can contribute:

* Bugs or Issues (issues or defects found when working with Sawtooth Hyper Directory)
* Core Features & Enhancements (expanded capabilities or optimization)
* New or Enhanced Documentation (improve existing documentation or create new)
* Testing Events and Results (functional, performance or scalability)

### Commit Process

Hyperledger Sawtooth Hyper Directory is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts
contributions via GitHub pull requests. When contributing code please do the
following:

* Fork the repository and make your changes in a feature branch.
* Please include unit and integration tests for any new features and updates to
existing tests.
* Please ensure the unit and integration tests run successfully. Refer to the
Testing section in the [README.md](README.md) on how to run these
tests.
* Please ensure that lint passes by running `./bin/run_lint`. The command should
produce no output if there are no lint errors. The linter requires all Python
dependencies be installed locally (if not it'll throw import-errors). Install
dependencies locally by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` from the
root project directory.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

Pull requests can contain a single commit or multiple commits. The most
important part is that **a single commit maps to a single fix or enhancement**.

Here are a few scenarios:

* If a pull request adds a feature but also fixes two bugs, then the pull
request should have three commits, one commit each for the feature and two bug
fixes.
* If a PR is opened with 5 commits that was work involved to fix a single issue,
it should be rebased to a single commit.
* If a PR is opened with 5 commits, with the first three to fix one issue and
the second two to fix a separate issue, then it should be rebased to two
commits, one for each issue.
* Your pull request should be rebased against the current master branch. Please
do not merge the current master branch in with your topic branch, nor use the
Update Branch button provided by GitHub on the pull request page.

#### Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow common Git conventions, such as the imperative
mood, separate subject lines, and a line-length of 72 characters. These rules
are well documented by Chris Beam in his [blog post on the subject](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
and summarized by the 7 rules of a great git commit message:

```markdown
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
3. Capitalize the subject line.
4. Do not end the subject line with a period.
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
```

#### Signed-off-by

Commits must include Signed-off-by in the commit message (git commit -s). This
indicates that you agree the commit satisfies the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO).

#### Version Tracking

Each PR **must** include a correctly updated semantic version number in `/VERSION`.
As of Jan/9/2019 we use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 as described [here](https://semver.org/).

A basic summary of Semantic Versioning is:

<pre>
Given a version number <b>MAJOR</b>.<b>MINOR</b>.<b>PATCH</b>, increment the:

  1. <b>MAJOR</b> version when you make incompatible API changes.
  2. <b>MINOR</b> version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
  3. <b>PATCH</b> version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the <b>MAJOR</b>.<b>MINOR</b>.<b>PATCH</b> format.
</pre>

### Important GitHub Requirements

**PLEASE NOTE**: Pull requests can only be merged after they have passed all
status checks.

These checks are:

* The PR must be approved by at least two reviewers and there cannot be
outstanding changes requested.
