        Hmmm.... Small hiccup. Something about your request
        isn't going through our validators. Not sure what the
        problem is exactly. Try again later.

  utter_send_failure_pending:
    - text: >-
        Oh no! It looks like it took my minions too long to
        complete your request. Please try again later.

    - text: >-
        Houston, we've had a problem.... I'm sorry to say
        that I was unable to request access for you right now.
        But please don't lose faith in me. Simply try again later.

  utter_no_owner:
    - text: >-
        Seeing as this role has no owner, what's a bot to do? I have

  utter_pending_pack:
    - text: >-
        I'll keep you posted as I hear from each approver. Keep in mind
        that even if an approver rejects a request, you'll still have access
        to any other roles of this pack that get approved. Bye for now!
